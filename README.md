A JavaScript library to interface with UPS API, it works with Node.js. The [documentation can be found here](https://jonyw4.github.io/ups-js/).

## üåü Features
This library its in **early stages**, so it doesn't have interfaces for all UPS features (Your PR is very welcome).

With this library you can:
- Create Shipment

## üìñ How to use?
Install the library
```bash
npm i ups-js
```

Import the library
```typescript
import UPS from 'ups-js';

const ups = new UPS(token, isSandbox, timeout);
const response = await ups.createShipment({...});
```

## üìö API Docs

This library provides a promise based interface for all functions. Before you
can use the library, you need to provide authentication details which will be
used through API calls.

For a detailed documentation, see our [Documentation](https://jonyw4.github.io/ups-js/).
